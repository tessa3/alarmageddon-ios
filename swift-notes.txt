Swift Method syntax
===================
Swift methods look like this: 

func appendDigit(sender: UIButton) -> Double {
	// append a digit
}

The "-> Double" is the return type of the function.


Connecting Storyboards to ViewControllers
=========================================
... works exactly the same as it did before. You Ctrl+drag the View from the storyboard into the ViewController's .swift file.

@IBOutlets are properties (instance variables), @IBActions are methods.

Constraint Misplacements
========================
There are three ways to fix a mixplacement:

1.) "Update Frame": this basically says "take into consideration all the rules, and move this label to where the rules say it should be." This is the preferred option.
2.) "Update Constraints": this is basically the "force constraints" button. This will force some meaningless constraint onto the view. You almost never want this option..
3.) "Reset Constraints": this one basically means "match the blue lines". This will probably work.


Constraints
===========
You can wire up constraints in XCode by holding Ctrl and dragging from a UI element to the background drawing.

If you begin to update constraints on a view in the storyboard, the horizontal and vertical lines will turn yellow for each of the "invalid" constraints that you have. To fix this, you have two options. Either:
1.) wire them up visually with a Ctrl-drag, or
2.) open the Document Outline button in the bottom and fix the issues on that view from there. There should be a yellow "issues" button in the top right of the Document Outline. You can fix misplacements by clicking the yellow "warning" icons in the misplacement.
